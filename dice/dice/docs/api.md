# Basic API

Everything starts at the base struct `Dice`.

From it, you can get the `TransactionUpdater` where you can report the changes to your computation graph you expect
to see this time. You can dirty nodes to be recomputed via `TransactionUpdater::changed`,
or report new [Injected Values](writing_computations.md#injected-keys) via `TransactionUpdater::changed_to`.
These changes recorded will not be seen by anyone until you commit them via `TransactionUpdater::commit`, which returns
you an instance of `DiceTransaction` containing all changes recorded up until this moment (but not any future changes).

`DiceTransaction` instances that have the same set of reported changes are considered to be of the same state. Computations
can be requested from them concurrently, and work will be shared.
However, concurrent requests to `DiceTransactions` with different states are NOT supported.
DICE currently does NOT enforce this rule. Please be aware.


The function `DiceComputations::compute(Key)` is used to compute a specific Key, returning a future to the result.
`DiceTransaction` derefs into a `DiceComputations` such computations can be called directly on the transaction.

To make code look natural, we often employ the pattern of writing computation traits as follows:
```rust
#[async_trait]
trait MyComputationTrait {
    async fn some_compute(&self, a: i32) -> i32;

    async fn more_compute(&self, b: &str) -> MyOutputType;
}

#[async_trait]
impl MyComputationTrait for DiceComputations {
    async fn more_compute(&self, b: &str) -> MyOutputType {
        self.compute(MyKey(b.to_owned()))
    }

    async fn some_compute(&self, a: i32) -> i32 {
        self.compute(MyOtherKey(a))
    }
}
```

This will let you write the more natural code as follows instead of having to explicitly create and refer to Keys everywhere in the code base:
```rust
use MyComputationTrait;

async fn main() {
    let dice = Dice::builder().build();

    let ctx = dice.updater().commit();

    ctx.more_compute("a").await;
    ctx.some_compute(1).await;
}
```

You can group computations in traits however you wish, with whatever Key types you desire. In buck2, we tend to group
related computations together (i.e all parsing computations in one trait, or all action computations in one trait) to
better organize our modules and limit the number of dependencies pulled in.
