# Testimonials

For XCode project generation:

> *"It’s faster and much easier to work with than the equivalent stack in Python. In Python, we’d have to issue a query, parse the output into BuildTarget objects, process them, perform additional queries or build targets/subtargets, etc. Doing the equivalent in BXL removed a lot of inefficiencies and made working with configured targets much easier."*

For Rust Analyzer:

> *"It was my first time using BXL, and it allowed me to get rid of about 800 lines of Rust code and replace it with about 60 lines of BXL. It's really handy."*
