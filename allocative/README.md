# Allocative: memory profiler for Rust

This crate implements a lightweight memory profiler which allows
object traversal and memory size introspection.

## Usage

`Allocative` trait (typically implemented with proc-macro) is introspectable:
`Allocative` values can be traversed and their size and sizes of referenced objects
can be collected.

This crate provides a few utilities to work with such objects,
the main of such utilities is flame graph builder which produces flame graph
(see the crate documentation) like this:

## How it is different from other call-stack malloc profilers like jemalloc heap profiler

Allocative is not a substitute for call stack malloc profiler,
it provides a different view of memory usage.

Here are some differences between allocative and call-stack malloc profiler:

* Allocative requires implementation of `Allocative` trait for each type
  which needs to be measured, and some setup in the program to enable it is needed
* Allocative flamegraph shows object by object tree, not by call stack
* Allocative shows gaps in allocated memory,
  e.g. spare capacity of collections or too large padding in structs or enums
* Allocative allows profiling of non-malloc allocations
  (for example, allocations within [bumpalo](https://github.com/fitzgen/bumpalo) bumps)
* Allocative allows profiling of memory for subset of the process data
  (for example, measure the size of RPC response before serialization)

## Runtime overhead

When allocative is used, binary size is slightly increased due to implementations
of [`Allocative`] trait, but it has no runtime/memory overhead when it is enabled but not used.
